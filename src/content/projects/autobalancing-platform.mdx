### This project set out to automatically balance a ball bearing on a touch screen platform. The hardware for the project was an ADAFRUIT resistive touchscreen, TSC2070 I2C Touch Screen Controller, two HS-311 servo motors, Raspberry Pi RP20240 microcontroller, and custom made platform and base.
        
To control the system behavior, a PID controller implemented using C code was flashed onto the memory of the microcontroller. Ultimately the code successfully ran and the system was built successfully.
