## In colaboration with the RoboMasters team at the University of Texas Arlington, we bring to you the first ever UTA fighting robot.

This project is in colaboration with the RoboMasters competition. We were tasked with developing a fighting robot with a full 360 degree turret. I had the privelege of particaipating with the drive train team.

The drive train team was responsible for the entire lower half of the robot. We designed and muanufactured a custom base, wheel mounts, pressure plate mounts, and wheel covers, as well as various smaller components to house the electrical hardware.
